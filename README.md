**Description**: Given a random weather app design from one of our peers, we are asked to code out the design and functionality of a weather app. This app should include 5 days of forecast, the current location's temperature, location name, date, and min/max temperature. There should also be a possible way to add favorite locations and bookmark or save them to view if needed.

**Review**: For some reason the getWeather() function doesnt work, the getWeatherLocation() one is fine but I cant really check for anything else, but besides that the design looks really good compared to the figma. Not really anything else I can say without the api working tho
