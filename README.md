**Description**: Given a random weather app design from one of our peers, we are asked to code out the design and functionality of a weather app. This app should include 5 days of forecast, the current location's temperature, location name, date, and min/max temperature. There should also be a possible way to add favorite locations and bookmark or save them to view if needed.
